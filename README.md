# Draw on Board
Just draw on the board.

## Purpose
This software is designed for situations where someone (even not "a computer person") just wants to draw on the screen and use the computer as a whiteboard. For this reason, any features that get in the way are subject to removal, and only features that contribute to presentation-style computer use will be added.
